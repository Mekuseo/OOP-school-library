# 📖 The OOP University Library app <a name="about-project"></a>

**The OOP University Library app** is a tool designed to assist the librarian in managing the library's collection of books and keeping track of borrowing activities. This app enables the librarian to perform the following tasks:

Add new students or teachers: The app provides functionality to add new members to the library system, including students and teachers. This allows for easy management of user records and identification when borrowing books.

Add new books: The librarian can add new books to the library's collection using the app. Each book can have attributes such as title, author, genre, and publication information. This ensures an organized inventory of available books.

Record borrowing activities: The app facilitates the recording of borrowing activities by keeping track of who borrows a particular book and when it is borrowed. This information is essential for maintaining a lending history and ensuring accountability.
